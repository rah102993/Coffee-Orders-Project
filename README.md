# Coffee Orders Project
This is a project that creates an interactive dashboard in Excel to showcase various charts and slicers for effective data analysis.
The project walks you through the following:
- A line chart for total sales over time
- A bar chart for sales by country
- Another bar chart which highlights the top 5 customers
- A column chart for coffee type according to quantity
- A timeline filter for date-based filtering
- Slicers for roast type, size, and loyalty card

While working on this project, I did the following;
1. Data Gathering:
I used VLOOKUP to populate data from orders, customers, and products tables.

2. Data Transformation:
I formatted the date, size, unit price, and sales columns as part of the data cleaning process.

3. Pivot Tables and Charts:
I employed pivot tables and charts to analyze and visualize the data.

4. Dashboard Design:
I created a visually applealing and interactive dashboard.

5. Slicer and Timeline Connections:
I connected a timeline and some slicers to to filter the data, and as well, kee the dashboard visually appealing.

6. Dashboard Enhancements:
I removed the grid lines in order to maintain a cleaner look of the dashboard.
